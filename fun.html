The phrase they think they're using ‚Äî Teufel Hunden ‚Äî is grammatically incorrect German.The original term is Teufelshunde. \n In late medieval Polish and German folklore, Teufelshund wasn‚Äôt a compliment ‚Äî it was a slur. Catholic priests allegedly used it to explain disturbing cases of dogs being raped, blaming it on the Devil himself. The term evolved into a vicious insult implying someone was the Devil‚Äôs bitch ‚Äî literally, a \"dog of the Devil.\" \n It later got thrown around as a dehumanizing insult for enemies ‚Äî first by Poles toward outsiders, and then by Germans during WWI. When American troops arrived, they heard the term and, encouraged by the British, misunderstood it as a compliment meaning \"hellhound.\" The Marines adopted it proudly ‚Äî completely unaware that in origin, it meant  Satan‚Äôs sex-pet." },

Actual ninjas wore ordinary clothes or muted tones like dark grey or navy, blending in like any other peasant, merchant, or servant. So where did the black-suited ninja stereotype come from? Japanese theatre. In traditional kabuki, stagehands (called kuroko) wore all black to signal invisibility ‚Äî audiences were trained to ignore them as they moved props or scenery. At some point, a director had the brilliant idea: what if one of those ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù black-clad stagehands suddenly stepped forward and assassinated a character mid-performance? It was electric. The audience lost their minds. And thus, a stage trick became a pop culture archetype: the ninja as invisible assassin, dressed like a stagehand, striking from nowhere." },
