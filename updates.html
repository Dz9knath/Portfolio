I realized that progress is often made in small, consistent actions rather than huge leaps forward. This blog will be my space to track those small victories, as well as share my challenges along the way. I hope that by writing more frequently, I'll keep myself accountable and maybe even inspire someone else to take their first step toward something they've been putting off.",
